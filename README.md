# RASN_Shiny
- RASN Network Generators Interactive Database - 

The data used in this app was collected, cleaned, and organised by C. Chueca Del Cerro and J. Badham. This app is the interactive version of a paper (in preparation for submission) where we carried out a literature review of different ways in which researchers can generate networks with specific properties and have organised these into a taxonomy.

First, you will find an information tab about the larger project on generating (R)ealistic (A)rtificial (S)ocial (N)etworks for simulation. On the second tab, there are some data insights about top 20 authors, journals, mechanisms used and structural properties targeted by the collection of papers. There is also a mosaic plot showing the use of mechanisms to target structural properties and can be separated by algorithm initialisation. The third tab is a searchable and interactive database of paper where you can export your desired references.
